            Iâ€™m a Data Science student at Cakrawala University, transitioning from a background in customer service and administration. With several years of experience in client handling and operational support, Iâ€™ve developed strong communication, problem-solving, and adaptability skills.
            <br /><br />
            Driven by curiosity and a passion for data, Iâ€™m now building my foundation in programming, statistics, and web development â€” learning tools like Python, SQL, and data visualization. Iâ€™m especially interested in how data can be processed, interpreted, and used to generate meaningful insights across various fields.
            <br /><br />
            Though Iâ€™m still in the early stages, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and excited to grow as a future data professional. Letâ€™s keep progressing and keep growing ðŸŒ±
